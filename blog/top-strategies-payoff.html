    <h1>Top 5 Strategies to Pay Off Your Home Loan Faster</h1>
    <p>Short intro: Why paying off faster matters — interest savings, peace of mind.</p>

    <h2>1. Make regular small extra payments</h2>
    <p>Even small monthly add-ons reduce interest and shorten tenure.</p>

    <h2>2. Make a lump-sum prepayment when you get a bonus</h2>
    <p>Large one-time payments have bigger compounding effect on interest saved.</p>

    <h2>3. Switch to shorter tenure if you can afford higher EMI</h2>
    <p>Reducing tenure reduces interest drastically.</p>

    <h2>4. Re-amortize (if your bank allows)</h2>
    <p>After prepayment, ask your bank to recalculate EMI/tenure.</p>

    <h2>5. Use the calculator to test scenarios</h2>
    <p>Run combinations of prepayment + tenure to pick optimal plan.</p>
